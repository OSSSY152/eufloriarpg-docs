Introduction
============

This page aims at giving a broad presentation of the modding functionality for Eufloria RPG and it's modding capabilities, as well as an overview of the 
contents of this documentation, so that you know where to start if you are a beginner or where to look if you need info on a specific feature.

About Eufloria RPG
------------------

Eufloria RPG is a game that is built with Unity and has been in development for over five years! It is a spiritual succesor to the succesful and original 
`Eufloria <https://www.eufloria-game.com>`_, just as the original was, Eufloria RPG is massively moddable, hopefully moddable enough that anyone can add 
their own original levels, or enemies, or even build your own games with the engine. Modding support is provided through two mechanisms.

About the documentation
-----------------------

This documentation is continuously written, corrected, edited and revamped by members of the Eufloria RPG team and
community. It is edited via text files in the `reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ markup
language and then compiled into a static website/offline document using the open source
`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ and `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ tools.

.. note:: You can contribute to the documentation by opening issues by sending patches 
            via pull requests on its GitHub `source repository <https://github.com/sillytuna/eufloriarpg-docs>`_.

Organisation of the documentation
---------------------------------

This documentation is organised in five sections, the way it is split up should be relatively intuitive:

- The :ref:`sec-general` section contains this introduction as well as general information on the tool It also contains
  the :ref:`doc_faq`.
- The :ref:`sec-learn` section is the the main entry point of this documentation, as it contains all the necessary
  information modding the game.
- Finally, the :doc:`../autoapi/index` is the documentation for the Eufloria RPG API. It is generated automatically from
  files in the main repository, and the generated files of the documentation are therefore not meant to be modified.
